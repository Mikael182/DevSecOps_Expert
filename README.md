# DevSecOps_Expert
The DevSecOps repository aims to collect and share practical tools and examples that help integrate security into the software development and infrastructure process (DevSecOps). Here you will find scripts for automating security tests, CI/CD pipeline configurations with a focus on security, and educational materials useful for developers, DevOps engineers, and security specialists. The repository is regularly updated, and we welcome feedback and collaboration.
